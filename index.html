        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>I am a UMass Amherst computer science sophomore. Studying front-end techniques and designing beautiful websites are all my passions. 
        <br/>
        I am currently hooked on React JS. Hire me! :)

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Projects are the always option I use to hone my coding skills. 
          <br/>
          If you are interested in what I have done, check out my porfolio: 
          <br/>
          Or you would like a summary? Well, in the portfolio, I include: 
          <ul>
            <li>My start up project's website: a front-end outlay I built under instruction from Brian Design's video. I use this outlay for me and my sister's start-up: A platform to connect people with advanced English skill and potential clients seeking English support like translator, English tutor, writing and editting. Tag: #styled-components, #reactjs,   </li>
            <li>Tetris game! I use React Hook as state management to build this simple game with the CSS referenced from Weiben Falk. Thanks a lot my favorite teacher :). </li>
            <li>Sudoku with pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I am currently working on this project with my friends. Much of the front-end work is done. We are waiting for a method using Backtracking algorithm to solve and generate more games. We are also working on a function to accept image input from users and produce a complete solution.</li>
            <li>Con Fusion Ristorance. I built this restaurant's website when I was studying Coursera React course. There was no React Hook back then, so I used Redux. For styling I use ReactStrap.</li>
            
          </ul>
