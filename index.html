      <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

      <p>
        Projects are the always option I use to hone my coding skills.
        Github: <a>https://github.com/nguyenvothuan</a>
        <br />
        Or you would like a summary? Well, in the portfolio, I include:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nguyenvothuan/2048/">Rebuild the 2048 </a> game with React and custom Hooks. Create responsive and animated UI with SCSS and open source gif. Program an AI to play against human using Expectimax algorithms with O(bm) time complexity that can reach 16384 with
          around 97% accuracy (based on a sample of 100 test cases).</li>
        <li><a href="https://nguyenvothuan.github.io/Tetris/">Tetris game!</a> I use React Hook as state management to
          build this simple game with the CSS referenced from Weiben Falk. Thanks a lot my favorite teacher :). </li>
        <li><a href="https://nguyenvothuan.github.io/Sudoku/">Sudoku</a> with pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I am currently
          working on this project with my friends. Much of the front-end work is done. We are working on a function to accept image
          input from users and produce a complete solution.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nguyenvothuan/C-Hashtag-Algorithm">C# Algorithm Library</a>. A collection of competitive programming problems written in C#. The contents are ranged from many categories: Dynamic
          Programming, Greedy Algorithm, Backtracking, Hashing, Graph, Tree, and Heap. Data structures are programmed to be multi-purpose and can be used as a Library.</li>
        
      </ul>
